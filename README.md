# 🔒 Cybersecurity Case Study: Comparative Analysis of Detection and Resolution Metrics in Company A and B

## 📍 Overview
This repository presents an in-depth **statistical analysis of cyberattack-related detection and resolution times** for two companies, Company A and Company B, focusing on ransomware, DDoS, and phishing attacks. The analysis was conducted as part of the **IE266 course at METU Industrial Engineering Department**, leveraging weekly data from 36 organizations over 52 weeks.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Total Financial Loss Analysis**: Quantified and compared losses due to ransomware, DDoS, and phishing for both companies.
- **Descriptive Statistics & Distribution Analysis**: Examined weekly financial loss variability, including measures like median, mean, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Assessed the relationship between detection time and resolution time for phishing attacks.
- **Comparative Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical comparison of detection times and resolution times across companies using confidence intervals and significance testing.
- **Success Rate Evaluation**: Determined the probability of successful detection rates exceeding specified thresholds.

## 📈 Analytical Techniques Used
- Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis)
- Visualization (histograms, scatterplots, density plots)
- Correlation Analysis (Pearson correlation coefficients)
- Hypothesis Testing (confidence intervals, population proportion testing)
- Comparison of variability and performance metrics across companies

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Company B** experienced higher overall financial losses, with ransomware being the dominant attack type.
- **Company A** showed less variability and a lower overall average loss, suggesting stronger resilience.
- **Strong correlation** (r ≈ 0.869) observed between detection and resolution times for phishing in Company B, while Company A showed negligible correlation (r ≈ 0.016).
- **Significant differences** in detection times and response performance between companies, validated via confidence intervals at high significance levels.
- **Company C’s response time** was statistically proven to be faster than Company B.
- **Company A’s detection success rate** significantly exceeds 55%, as evidenced by hypothesis testing.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- 📄 **Case Study Report**: Includes introduction, problem statement, analysis methodology, statistical outputs, and conclusions.
- 📊 **Visualizations**: Histograms, scatterplots, and pie charts used to illustrate financial losses, correlation trends, and distribution patterns.
- 🧮 **Statistical Results**: Tables summarizing descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and confidence intervals.
